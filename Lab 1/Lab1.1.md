# What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool?

# Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities?

# When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for?

# How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities? What are the drawbacks in this regard?

# If an environment does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices, should tools be introduced?

Introducing tools to an environment that does not currently engage in solid RE practices may not be sufficient or effective. Tools are only one aspect of RE, and they cannot replace the human skills and expertise required for eliciting, analyzing, validating, and managing requirements3 Moreover, tools may introduce new challenges, such as learning curves, compatibility issues, integration problems, and maintenance costs

# What sort of problems might you find through a traceability matrix that you might not see without one?

- Missing requirements: A traceability matrix can show if there are any requirements that are not covered by any test cases, design documents, or code modules. This can indicate a gap in the requirements analysis or specification process
- Redundant requirements: A traceability matrix can also show if there are any requirements that are covered by multiple test cases, design documents, or code modules. This can indicate a duplication or overlap in the requirements definition or implementation process
- Inconsistent requirements: A traceability matrix can help to check if the requirements are consistent across different levels of abstraction, such as business, functional, and technical. This can help to avoid conflicts or contradictions in the requirements specification or validation process
- Unnecessary requirements: A traceability matrix can help to assess if the requirements are relevant and necessary for the project scope and objectives. This can help to eliminate any requirements that are out of scope, outdated, or unrealistic
- Impact of changes: A traceability matrix can help to analyze the impact of changes in the requirements on the other project artifacts, such as test cases, design documents, or code modules. This can help to identify and manage the risks and costs associated with the changes

# How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications?

AI is being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications in various ways, such as:
- Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and extract requirements from textual sources, such as user feedback, documents, or web pages
- Using knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) techniques to model and manipulate requirements as logical or probabilistic structures, such as ontologies, rules, or graphical models
- Using machine learning (ML) techniques to learn and refine requirements from data, such as user behavior, system performance, or environmental changes
